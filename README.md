## Abstract
Olympic weightlifting requires technical skills, explosive power, strength, and coordination. Weightlifters can be competitive within a range of morphological characteristics due to competition body weight classes. To date, no studies have examined when sex and age differences arise in weightlifting and the impact of body weight on performances at different ages.

## Introduction
Women athletes are known to be less strong and powerful than equally trained men. The main factor accounting for gender differences in maximal strength,indeed, has been identified as age. To the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have compared age of male and female athletes or the relation between body weight and the maximum weight athletes can lift. Therefore, the first aim of this study is to answer whether there is any difference in the average age of female and male weightlifters. Beside that, the second aim of the present study was to assess the relationships between the body weight of weightlifters and the weight lifted in sports with high expressions of strength and power.

## Research Question
- **Is there any difference in the average age of female and male weightlifters?**
- **What is the relation between the body weight of weightlifters and the weight lifted?**

## Method
- **Two independent sample t-test method**
- **The hypothesis test for the linear relationship**

## Conclusion
I quantified the impact of body weight and age and sex differences for weightlifters from the sample of 261 participants. The answer to the first question stated at the beginning of this study is that there is no difference between the average age of female and male weightlifters.

Besides that, there is a linear relationship between the body weight of the athletes and the maximum weight they can lift regardless the gender. Such results may help to establish progression trajectories for talented athletes and inform coaches, athletes, and national governing bodies.
